    <h1>Details</h1>

    <a href="#top">
      <h2 id="s38">S38B38</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      The BMW S38 is a straight-6 DOHC petrol engine which replaced 
      the M88 and was produced from 1984-1995. The S38 was originally 
      produced for North America as an equivalent to the M88 with 
      slightly lower power output. In 1989, power output of the S38 
      was increased and it became the worldwide replacement for the M88.
    </p>
    <p>
      In late 1991, BMW further enlarged the S38 engine to 3,795 cc, by 
      increasing the bore to 94.6 mm and the stroke to 90 mm. Power 
      increased to 335 hp at 6,900 rpm and torque increased to 400 N⋅m at 4,750 rpm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engine management was upgraded to Motronic 3.3 and the ignition 
      system was upgraded to coil-on-plug ignition. Other changes include 
      the compression ratio increasing to 10.5:1, a dual-mass flywheel, an 
      exhaust manifold made from 
      <i title="Inconel is a registered trademark of Special Metals Corporation for a family of austenitic nickel-chromium-based superalloys.">
        Inconel
      </i>, 
      larger intake and exhaust valves, 
      lighter pistons, and the throttle bodies increasing by 4 mm to 50 mm.
    </p>

    <a href="#top">
      <h2 id="m60">M60B40</h2>
    </a>    
    <p>
      The BMW M60 is a naturally aspirated V8 petrol engine which was produced 
      from 1992 to 1996. It was BMW's first V8 engine in over 25 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M60 engine has double overhead camshafts with four valves per 
      cylinder. The camshaft is driven by a dual-row timing chain with 
      a self-adjusting tensioner. Valves had hydraulic lash adjustment 
      to reduce maintenance. The ignition and fuel injection systems are 
      controlled by the Bosch Motronic 3.3 system, and the ignition 
      system is a coil-on-plug design with knock sensors.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reduce weight, the engine uses aluminum for both the engine 
      block and cylinder head, magnesium valve covers and a plastic 
      intake manifold. The M60 was BMW's first car engine to use a "split 
      conrod" design, where sintered connecting rods are made as a single 
      piece and then fractured in order to ensure increased rigidity and 
      an exact fit. The dry weight of the engine is between 175 kg and 203 kg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M60B40 has a bore of 89 mm and a stroke of 80 mm, for a total 
      displacement of 3,982 cc. Compression ratio is 10.0:1, giving 282 
      bhp at 5800 rpm and 400 N⋅m at 4500 rpm. It had a forged crankshaft.
    </p>

    <a href="#gearboxes">
      <h2 id="280">Getrag 280</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      Modified version of Getrag 260, with longer gears.
    </p>

    <a href="#gearboxes">
      <h2 id="420g">Getrag 420G</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      The 420G is a 6-speed manual transmission with overdriven last gear. 
      It is designed for longitudinal engine applications and is designed 
      for use on engines producing up to 499 N⋅m of torque. Also it was the 
      first 6-speed gearbox, that was installed in civil cars.
    </p>

    <a href="#others">
      <h2 id="body">Body changes</h2>
    </a>
    <p>
      Cosmetic changes to the exterior from the standard E34 included 
      unique front and rear bumpers and side rocker panels, contributing 
      to a drag coefficient of 0.32 (from 0.30), and interior updates 
      included a unique gearshift surround and rear headrests.
    </p>
    <p>
      BMW also used a dual-mass flywheel in place of the single in the 
      3.6-litre version for a smoother idle and throttle input at the 
      expense of response. The standard self-leveling suspension (SLS) 
      system, which maintained a constant ride height in the rear, was 
      replaced with Electronic Damper Control (EDCIII+), an electronically 
      controlled and hydraulically regulated system that can switch between 
      comfort "P" setting and a more track-oriented "S" setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The M5 came with an unusual wheel design. From 1988 to 1992 the M5 
      featured the three-piece Style 20 "M-System" wheels, which consisted 
      of directional bolted-on wheel covers and a fin assembly in front of 
      the black, 5-spoke forged aluminum wheel. The purpose of the M-System 
      cover was to divert heat from the brake assembly to increase cooling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1992 BMW changed the design to the "M-System II" (nicknamed "throwing 
      stars") which improved brake cooling from the combination of the larger 
      openings and fins placed in the driving direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In May 1994, the M5 switched to 18-inch Style 37 "M Parallel" 
      wheels that did away with the finned cover entirely.
